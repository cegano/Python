<p>This program allows the user to enter a series of exam scores. The number of scores the user can enter is not fixed; they can enter any number of scores they want. The exam scores can be either integers or floats. Then, once the user has entered all the scores they want, this program will calculate and print the average of those scores. After printing the average, the program terminates.  Nemeric sentinel is 9999.  The score is rejected if not < 0 or > 100, valid scores are appended to a list.  Once user has entered all the numbers they want the average of the scores is calculated to one decimal place.</p>

<p>Using Python code to read a txt file, essentially a table is made from the txt file displaying 26 rows of data.  It includes two functions, a main function and a function that calculates the total for each customer, receiving as parameters the price and quantity for each customer when called from the main loop. Knowing how to do arguments/return values is a goal of the exercise.</p>
