<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%201>Program 1</a></h2>
<p>This program prompts the user to enter a numeric temperature value that may be a float. A second prompt then asks the user to indicate whether the user wants the entered temperature value converted to degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit by entering either an 'F' or a 'C' for a second prompt. </p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%202>Program 2</a></h2>
<p>This program allows the user to enter a series of exam scores. The number of scores the user can enter is not fixed; they can enter any number of scores they want. The exam scores can be either integers or floats. Then, once the user has entered all the scores they want, this program will calculate and print the average of those scores. After printing the average, the program terminates.  Nemeric sentinel is 9999.  The score is rejected if not < 0 or > 100, valid scores are appended to a list.  Once user has entered all the numbers they want the average of the scores is calculated to one decimal place.</p>

<p>Using Python code to read a txt file, essentially a table is made from the txt file displaying 26 rows of data.  It includes two functions, a main function and a function that calculates the total for each customer, receiving as parameters the price and quantity for each customer when called from the main loop. Knowing how to do arguments/return values is a goal of the exercise.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%204>Program 4</a></h2>
<p>This program is meant to read a list of dictionairies, from the included data file, using DictReader() and uses DictWriter() to store any added data.  There is a menu of four options for the user to choose from:  One to display all data for all racers, one to display a runners individual race average in minutes, one to add a new runner and race data and the last to save and store all data back to the data file.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%205>Program 5</a></h2>
<p>Using a database from SQLite3 this program uses information from speeding tickets on a certain day in a particular area.  The program has functions that allow all of the data to be displayed, a new ticket to be added and a filter that enables tickets by either males or females to be displayed.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%201-PyII>Program 6</a></h2>
<p>In this program, I used a python class to represent contact information and helper function to print data requested.  The user may enter a number from a list of options: 1. Display all contacts, 2. Add new contact and 3. Save and quit.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%202-PyII>Program 7</a></h2>
<p>wxPython is utilized in this program.  TextCtrl, radio buttons, check boxes, buttons and StaticText boxes are used to create an order form for the user to utilize.  When the 'Calculate Total' button is pressed by the user their total is calculated and a shipping summary is displayed below the buttons.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%203-PyII>Program 8</a></h2>
<p>Similarly to the last program, this program utilizes wxPython, adding in wxListCtrl and wxDialog box as well as adding a database created by me using SQLite.  It includes 3 buttons, one to display all of the ticket data into the list control.  Another button is used to open a wx Dialog that allows the user to enter the 8 data items used for an individual record, when the user closes the dialog the new record will be SQL INSERTED to the tickets table (speeding_ticket.db) and the list control re-populated so as to display the inserted record. Lastly there is a close button to close the program.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%204-PyII>Program 9</a></h2>
<p>Using wxPython, this program connects to a database in SQLite to get previous data about 9 stocks.  This program then connects to an API called finnhub.io to retrieve current data on said stocks.  Once that data is retrieved it is compared to the saved data from the database, i.e. the current price for each stock with the original purchase price. Then, using the number of shares purchased, the current profit or loss for each stock is calculated and displayed.  The net profit or loss after looking the results of all 9 of the individual stock values to see overall gains or losses.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%205-PyII>Program 10</a></h2>
<p>This program is about very basic web site navigation as well as having the browser and web server interact with a simple database using Bottly.py. Two tables from a database are used to authenticate login information and display data about a particular user's work trip information using simple template files to navigate. As well as displaying data, the user may add trip data to the database table.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/cegano/Python/tree/main/Program%206-PyII>Program 11</a></h2>
<p>Similarly to Program 10, Bottle.py and a database with two tables are used. The user is able to view weekly pay calculations for employees filtered by department and to edit or update the hours worked for a given employee. Unlike the previous program, the navigation uses a main layout template that includes Bootstrap styling that allows substituting in the sub templates.
