<p>This program prompts the user to enter a numeric temperature value that may be a float. A second prompt then asks the user to indicate whether the user wants the entered temperature value converted to degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit by entering either an 'F' or a 'C' for a second prompt. </p>

<p>This program allows the user to enter a series of exam scores. The number of scores the user can enter is not fixed; they can enter any number of scores they want. The exam scores can be either integers or floats. Then, once the user has entered all the scores they want, this program will calculate and print the average of those scores. After printing the average, the program terminates.  Nemeric sentinel is 9999.  The score is rejected if not < 0 or > 100, valid scores are appended to a list.  Once user has entered all the numbers they want the average of the scores is calculated to one decimal place.</p>

<p>Using Python code to read a txt file, essentially a table is made from the txt file displaying 26 rows of data.  It includes two functions, a main function and a function that calculates the total for each customer, receiving as parameters the price and quantity for each customer when called from the main loop. Knowing how to do arguments/return values is a goal of the exercise.</p>

<p>This program is meant to read a list of dictionairies, from the included data file, using DictReader() and uses DictWriter() to store any added data.  There is a menu of four options for the user to choose from:  One to display all data for all racers, one to display a runners individual race average in minutes, one to add a new runner and race data and the last to save and store all data back to the data file.</p>

<p>Using a database from SQLite3 this program uses information from speeding tickets on a certain day in a particular area.  The program has functions that allow all of the data to be displayed, a new ticket to be added and a filter that enables tickets by either males or females to be displayed.</p>
